> A consistent framework for credit risk modeling and analysis

scikit-risk provides a unified interface for common credit risk modeling analysis tasks in Python. The package has recently been created. Initial functionality will focus on approaches for evaluating credit risk ratings, but the package is expected to undergo consistent development to add additional [scikit-learn] compatible tools to analyze credit risk and build, tune and validate credit models.
